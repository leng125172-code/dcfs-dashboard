# WhaleDeck

Whale Deck is a containerized control plane for the Precision 7920 workstation, with a host-side Agent and maintenance entry point. It is under active development: platform status, Authentik identity, portals and restricted container management are being implemented. GitLab integration is deferred.

See [implementation status](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for the distinction between implemented code, placeholders and pending workstation acceptance. A passing build does not mean the complete backend is ready for production.

## Technology

- ASP.NET Core 10 Web API and .NET Worker Service
- EF Core 10 with Npgsql for PostgreSQL 18
- Valkey 9 for expiring cache and authorization snapshots via the Redis-compatible distributed-cache interface
- Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Pinia, Vue Router, and Element Plus
- Nginx gateway serving the Vue build and proxying API and Authentik traffic

The repository is a modular monolith. `Domain` has no infrastructure dependency, `Application` contains use cases and ports, `Infrastructure` implements persistence and external integrations, and `Api` owns HTTP/OIDC concerns.

WhaleDeck has no local password store and does not duplicate Authentik user profiles. Interactive login uses Authentik through the backend OIDC authorization-code flow. Authentik subject IDs and group claims are mapped to platform-specific permissions and immutable audit events; Authentik remains the source of truth for names, email addresses, groups, credentials, MFA, and account state.

## Product scope

The product baseline starts in [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md). The complete page, use-case, Agent RPC, permission, data-model, and delivery breakdown is indexed in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Branch model

- `master`: stable, deployable releases only
- `dev`: integration branch for active development
- Feature branches start from `dev` and merge back into `dev`
- Release changes move from `dev` to `master` through a pull request

Direct feature work must not be committed to `master`.

## Local verification

```powershell
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build

Set-Location web
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm lint
corepack pnpm test:unit
corepack pnpm build
```

If the workstation exports a SOCKS URL through `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY`, Node/Corepack may reject it. Clear those variables only for the current install process or provide the local proxy using an `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` URL. Do not change the system proxy as part of the project scripts.

## Runtime configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set mode `0600` on Linux, and replace every placeholder. Secrets are never committed. Infrastructure settings come from environment variables, dynamic platform settings live in PostgreSQL, and public Vue settings are written to `/tmp/runtime-config.js` when the gateway starts.

The intended canonical URLs are:

- WhaleDeck: `http://192.168.22.19:8080`
- Authentik: `http://192.168.22.19:8081`
- GitLab: `http://192.168.22.19:8082` (added when GitLab is deployed)

The host-side MaintenanceHost binds both `192.168.22.19` and `192.168.100.13`. The gateway publishes only loopback upstream ports (`18080` and `18081`). API, Worker, databases, cache and Authentik do not publish host ports. API and Worker must never mount `/var/run/docker.sock`; container operations use the Agent Unix socket and an allow-listed resource registry.

## Staged installation

The [installation guide](deploy/install/README.md) describes the seven-stage Linux workflow: tool/source checks, optional Docker accelerator configuration, dependency repository deployment, then source build and deployment. `bash install.sh --dry-run` previews the workflow without network or system changes. `--dependencies-only` excludes the Whale Deck build/deployment stage.

The scripts are not a production-acceptance claim. Workstation acceptance is pending and no Whale Deck container image has been built or started as part of the current implementation.

## Container boundaries

- `whaledeck-gateway`: `whaledeck-app-ui` and `database-platform-app-authentik`
- `whaledeck-api`: `whaledeck-app-ui`, `database-platform-app-authentik`, `database-platform-db-postgres`, and `database-platform-cache-general`
- `whaledeck-worker`: `database-platform-db-postgres` and `database-platform-cache-general`
- `migrator`: one-shot tool on `database-platform-db-postgres`, run before API/Worker start

Docker uses the `local` logging driver with a maximum of five compressed 10 MiB files per container. Application request logs below server errors are emitted at debug level to avoid repeating the previous log-volume incident.

The Dockerfiles provide pinned development tag defaults. Before a formal installation, create `.images.env` from `.images.env.example` with immutable base-image digests. The installer rejects missing digests before the image-build stage. Record approved digests in release configuration; never mix credentials into image-version files.
